    Add an AutomorphismComposite that averages over graphically related
    embeddings using a common set of nodes and edges. This makes use of
    the new automorphism functionality in dwave-experimental.
    Add a simple example demonstrating how the AutomorphismComposite
    mitigates for control errors in a similar manner to
    SpinReversalTransformComposite.
