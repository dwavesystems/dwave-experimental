    The embedding examples are expanded to include a case with detector and
    target only, and an example of distillation of a fully sourced and detected
    Chimera graph.
    A multicolor annealing example is presented demonstrating effectiveness of
    flux shimming for zero magnetization, and anneal-offsets for target qubit
    frequency synchronization.
