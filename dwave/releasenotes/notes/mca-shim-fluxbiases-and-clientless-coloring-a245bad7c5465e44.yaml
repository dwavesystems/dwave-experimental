    "x_polarizing_schedules" in ``sampling_params`` is detected as a
    symmetry-breaking parameter, allowing the symmetry-detection functionality
    in shimming routines to operate correctly for multicolor annealing.

    A utility is added that assigns anneal lines to Advantage2 processor
    nodes under the 6-annealing line scheme most often used. This function
    does not require a client, but is compatible with client returned
    color assignments.
